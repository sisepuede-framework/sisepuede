Units: Tera Joules/Tonne = (TJ)/(1000kg)

Source:
	-National energy consumption per industry in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, 
	"IEA Energy efficiency indicators database (December 2022 edition)", 
	available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

    - To compute the National to local share of industrial energy we used:

Assumptions: 

    National energy indusrtial consumption per tonne is assumed to be the same as the local consumtion per tonne.
    In oder words, the ratio of national to local consumption is the same as the ratio of national to local production,
    therefore the national fraction TJ/Tonne remains equal.

    For 'consumpinit_inen_energy_total_pj_agriculture_and_livestock' and 'consumpinit_inen_energy_tj_per_mmm_gdp_other_product_manufacturing' national energy indusrtial consumption is scaled 
    by the share of national to local energy consumption in Trillion BTU

    Projected values are the same as the last historical value
