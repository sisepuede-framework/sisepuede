Units: Tera Joules/Tonne = (TJ)/(1000kg)

Source:
	-Energy in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, 
	"IEA Energy efficiency indicators database (December 2022 edition)", 
	available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

	-Tonne production obtained from IPPU data.

Assumptions: 

    If end use energy data is missing then:
        If it is present for some years:
            the missing historic values are obtained as the mean value of the present data
        Else:
            A multi-linear regression trained with the end use energy value as function of the rural population, urban population
            and GDP in the Socioeconomic folder is used to compute the missing values.

    Projected values for energy are obtained with the previously mentioned multi-linear regression with the pop_ur, pop_ru and gdp
    projected values from the Socioeconomic folder.
