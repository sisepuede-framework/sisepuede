  subsector :   Energy Technology
  longname :  Fraction of technologyâ€™s capacity that is available to reserve margin. Biogas 
  units: Multiplier that defines the level of reserve production capacity for a region, fuel, and year - i.e., capacity beyond what is needed to meet production requirements.

aditional_information:
      assumptions: >
          In order to convert to GW (Gigavatio) to MW (Megavatio), multiply the value by factor 1000.
          The reserve margin is calculated following smith (2010): 
          
                      (1)                               (2)                   (3) = (1)-(2)        (4) = (3)/(2)     
          Total Generating Capacity (MW)     Peak Electrical Demand (MW)      Reserves (MW)      Reserve Margin (%)
                     12,000                            10,000                     2,000                20

          For the Peak Electrical Demand, we used the Lousiana's 2030 Energy Efficiency Roadmap report. According to the report, the
          peak demand estimated will grow at an average annual rate of 0.8% from 14,283 MW in 2010, to 15,351 MW in 2020 and
          16,830 MW in 2030.
