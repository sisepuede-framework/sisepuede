Units: Tera Joules/Tonne = (TJ)/(1000kg)

Source:
	-Energy in Peta Joules obtained from: International Energy Agency, 
	"IEA Energy efficiency indicators database (December 2022 edition)", 
	available on the IEA data and statistics webpage (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)

	-Tonne production obtained from IPPU data.

Assumptions: 

    National energy consumption per tone is assumed to be the same as the local consumtion per tonne.
    In oder words, the ratio of national to local consumption is thete same as the rio of national to local production,
    therefore the national fraction TJ/Tonne remains equal.

    Projected values are the same as the last historical value
